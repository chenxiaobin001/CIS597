readme:


there are 3 ruby files in hw1:
 
1. plagiarismPair.rb contains only scripts, no methods, so no tests for it
2. myFileReader.rb contains two methods, but two methods both involve FILE IO, so no tests for them.
3. detectPlagiarism.rb contains five methods(including custom comparator, constructor), so there are 16 tests for them, in testDetectPlagiarism.rb.
